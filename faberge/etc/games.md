game 1 (80, 64, 52, 41)
-----------------------

    colored airtone chain alone ("mp") (80@4, 64@4, 52@4)

    colored airtone chain ("mf") + glow cell (p) at middles (64@4)

    ibid ("f") + glow cell with suffixed colortrills at middles (52@4)

    low glow cells swell-alternate with suffixed colortrills (41@4)
    low glow cells (p < mf > p)
    suffixed colortrills (p < mf > p)

    swell-shaped suffixed colortrills alone (41@2)
    [metric modulation introduced by woodblock]

game 2 (80, 100, 125, 156)
--------------------------

    meccanico cell becomes high glow cell (80@6)
    [woodblock metric modulation persists for a bit]
    [swell-shaped suffixed colortrills persist]

    meccanico cell becomes high glow cell (100@6)

    high glow cell repeats (125@8)

    high glow cell repeats (156@10)

game 3 (156, 125, 100)
----------------------

    [heterogenous cells]
    ppppp ratchet spazzolati prefix suffixed rimbalzandi (156@4)

    [fade-in]
    ppppp ratchet spazzolati continue
    ppppp desynchronized suffixed colortrills appear (156@4)

    [transformation]
    ppp suffixed rimbalzandi, suffixed colortrills synchronize (125@4)

    [cells]
    ppp synchronized suffixed rimbalzandi with suffixed colortrills (125@2)

    [transformation + exit]
    p suffixed colortrills become loure pulses with superball groans
    suffixed rimbalzandi drop out (100@2)

    [cells]
    loure pulses with superball groans (100@2)

    ===
    simultaneous woodblock + damped piano articulation of cells
    ppppp, ppp, p

game 4 (52, 64)
---------------

    [overlapping cell layers]
    castanet-prefixed, -suffixed clb cells (52@4)
    [loure pulses with superball groans persist]

    [cells]
    castanet-prefixed, -suffixed clb cells (52@2)
    [loure pulses drop out]

    [transformation + entrance]
    castanet clb cells become colored doubletrill castanets (80:64@4)
    bcl 9-way colorfinger variation appears

    [state]
    colored doubletrill castanets (64@4)
    [bcl 9-way colorfinger variation continues]

game 5 (100, 125, 156)
----------------------

    [state + entrance]
    piccolo fluttertongue becomes tremolo electricity (100@2)
    [colored doubletrill castanets persist]
    [bcl 9-way colorfinger variation persists]

    [state + exit]
    piccolo fluttertongue (100@2)
    [colored doubletrill castanets drop out]
    [bcl 9-way colorfinger variation persists]

    [transformation + fade-out]
    piccolo fluttertongue, tremolo electricity swell-alternate (100@4)
    [piccolo fluttertongue recedes]
    [bcl 9-way colorfinger variation fades out]

    [transformation]
    tremolo electricity becomes shakers electricity (125@8)

    [transformation]
    shakers electricity becomes tutti electricity (156@8)

    [state]
    tutti electricity (156@8)
