FABERGÉ - STAGES

[A]
very active investigation of the broken shell transformed into investigation of
the jewelers' desk.

* broken shell (β): single pitch rapidly exchanged between piccolo,
  upperregister clarinet, bowed crotale, violin; together with va, vc harmonic
  tremolo on lower fundamentals filling out harmonic field; together with ff
  lowregister pf strike activating silently depressed harmonic field. ff
  lowregister pf strike descends stepwise during segment. harmony of silently
  depressed pf notes ascend stepwise during segment.

* broken shell (β) culmination: oboe doppeltrill. idea of coruscating climax
  given so early in the piece: doppeltrill is achieved but subject to a process
  of dynamic enveloping that makes the material recede and then draw back forth
  and then recede and then draw back forth and so on while other materials
  progress and overlap. culmination: oboe doppeltrill, lateral piano A0 scrape,
  no crotales, sustained piccolo flz, sustained clarinet, sustained lowregister
  vc note played extremely ponticello, sustained midregister vn, va pochissimo
  scratch pedal.

* jewelers' desk (γ): glowing bfl multiphonics, eh keynoise, bcl multiphonics,
  attackless lowregister marimba pedal, lowregister vc pedal.

* intermittent golden gears (α): intermittent single strokes of white noise.
  intermittent shudders of pitches at beginning of single strokes of white
  noise. intermittent shudders of pitches at end of single strokes of white
  noise. stray single lines with regular rhythmic figuration.

great turning of the golden gears.

bfl sputter gesture (α) of starting up: alternation between three microtonal
notes at very bottom of range with transitions indicating changes in amount of
air included in the tone and at very quiet dynamics with pervasive swell
enveloping to and from niente. intermitent displacements of exactly one octave
up.

english horn sputter gesture (α) of starting up: color trill in upperregister
set to a quiet dynamic with niente-swell enveloping.

bcl sputter gesture (α) of starting up: same as bfl and scored on arrive on D3
and allow for 9-way colorfinger variation.

pf sputter gesture (α) of starting up: extremely thin single points of credit
card run laterally up A0 string followed by sizable pause. [use tablature of
glissandi notated against compass of A0 string from midbar to tuning peg.]
progresses to slow segment of lateral glissando followed by quicker and longer
segment of lateral glissando followed by a pause. progresses to three-stage
later glissando with the first two stages toward the tuning peg and the third
short stage quickly reversing direction followed by forte on-the-keys strike of
very low note played as a harmonic and used to excited silently depressed
harmonic field sustained with middle pedal. progresses to four-stage lateral
glissando with direction reversals following every stage except the first
followed by sfz harmonic excitor of harmonic field followed by a pause.

perc sputter gesture (α) of starting up: tight whitenoise brush tremolo on bd
head enveloped with a swell followed by a short rest followed by a quiet stroke
of superball mallet on bd head enveloped with a swell and of moderate duration,
all followed by a sizable pause. progresses to tight whitenoise brush tremolo
followed by simultaneous superball stroke on db head together with brush stroke
on bd head. progresses to whitenoise tremolo followed by simultaneous superball
and brush stroke followed by pp fingertapping on bd head. progresses to much
loud superball strokes and much longer durations of fingertapping.
fingertapping progresses to attackless mallet tremolo on bd head, eventually
played at as loud a dynamic as possible without revealing the mallet attacks.

vn, va sputter gesture (α) of starting up: triple-struck rimbalzando followed
by short, quiet, isolated tremolo flautando on same pitch followed. progresses
to triple-struck rimbalzando followed by two or three tremoli flautandi in
succession.

vc sputter gesture (α) of starting up: pair of 1/2 clt sfz strokes with lh
glissando at a width of a major second up and down followed by tremolo alla
punta (non flautando) scored with a crescendo. progresses to pair of 1/2 clt
sfz glissando strokes followed by two or three waves of swelled tremolo alla
punta. progresses to same 1/2 clt initiation followed by countless waves of
tremolo alla punta with continuous scp control. widths of glissandi increase to
a major ninth during development of material. progresses to include oscilliandi
harmonichi ponticelli after 1/2 clt glissando strokes and before tremolo alla
punta.
