process of alternation over segment: first term is broken shell, second term is
composite papers and kiln.

first term: broken shell: fast tempo: vn, va, vc harmonic trem. flaut. of frame
descending from bridge. underneath trem. and starting at same time is rapid
exchange of single pitch in other players in preparation for oboe double-trill
of broken shell. exchanged note is fluttertongue in piccolo and color trill in
clarinet; oboe does not yet participate. tremolo flautando frame keeps interest
in dynamic enveloping. string tremolo frame persists subito ppp at end of each
stage as pedal to the following stage. possible that when material returns at
each pass through alternation that note exchanged between piccolo and clarinet
changes, usually rising but sometimes falling and always with stepwise motion,
sometimes on quartertones.

second term: papers and kiln: slow tempo: single, protracted stroke of sponge
across bass drum head combined with very sparse single harpsichord notes
starting in only lower register of the instrument. second term is a type of
intercalation. and end of second term string tremolo frame crescendos to resume
first term.

process of alternation: at each successive occurence of second term,
harpsichord density increases and register rises. material starts with very
sparse feather beams that do not yet have the identity of feather beams.
density increases to reveal identity of feather beams. then straight-valued
rhythms interpolate to gradually replace feather beams. endpoint in run-away
harpsichord in only the upper register of the instrument. global accelerandi
and ritardandi inflect endpoint of material.

second term: runaway harpsichord as a solo; further registral compression yet
to come.
string tremolo frame is now silent.
brushed bass drum is silent.
oboe has been tacet from beginning of piece.

[A13]
runaway harpsichord continues with registral compression.
oboe enters on succession of three or so trilled notes.

[A14]
runaway harpsichord continues with registral compression.
piccolo fluttertongue and clarinet color trill exchange returns.
pitch exchange begins process of alternation with oboe trills.
important difference is that oboe line moves pitches between at each attack
but that pitch exchange line insists on single fixed pitch that will
be the terminal pitch-class of oboe doppeltrill.

[A15]
runaway harpsichord continues, possibly beginning registral descent.
oboe returns on succession of more trilled notes played quicker.

[A16]
runaway harpsichord continues, possibly with registral descent.
pitch exchange reutrns with even quicker exchange that now grows to include
piccolo fluttertongue, clarinet color trill and sharply bowed crotale.

[A17]
runaway harpsichord continues, possibly with registral descent.
oboe returns on succession of even more trilled notes played even more quickly.

[A18]
runaway harpsichord continues, possibly with registral descent and decreasing
density.
pitch exchange reutrns with even quicker exchange that now grows to include
piccolo fluttertongue, clarinet color trill, sharply bowed crotale and vc
single-note tremolo played extremely ponticello.

[A19]
runaway harpsichord continues, possibly with registral descent and decreasing
density.
oboe returns on truly rapid succession of trills still with changing pitch.

[A20]
runaway harpsichord continues, possibly with registral descent and decreasing
density.
oboe rapid trills continue.
pitch exchange returns and now grow to include piccolo fluttertongue, clarinet
color trill, sharply bowed crotale, vc xp single-note tremolo, va xp
single-note tremolo, vn xp single-note tremolo.
first tutti moment in piece.

[A21]
global accelerando begins.
continues as previous stage with addition of:
oboe moves by step to penultimate pitch position;
interval between oboe and other players is precadential;

[A22]
global accelerando continues.
continues as previous stage with addition of:
harpsichord completes process of thinning and descent, and falls silent.
oboe and other instruments insist on precadential interval for a significant
period of time. 

[A23]
global accelerando achieves new tempo.
pf remains tacet.
upper instruments move up by step; oboe moves down by step; unison achieved.

[A24]
upper instruments begin process of rhythmic regularization.
oboe begins process of increasing rhythm density.

[A25]
continues both processes of previous stage.

[A26]
continues both processes of previous stage.

[A27]
continues both processes of previous stage.

[A28]
continues both processes of previous stage.

[A29]
continues both processes of previous stage.

[A30]
both processes achive endpoint:
oboe trill is now completely continuous.
percussion falls silent.
upper instruments glue into a single sustained unison with no internal
reiteration and that is subito mp.
stage holds just this state.

[A31]
two more processes begin:
oboe begins process of irregularly increasing both dynamics and rate of trill.
upper instruments begin process of smoothly decreasing both dynamics and rate
of reattack.

[A32]
continues both processes of previous stage.

[A33]
continues both processes of previous stage.

[A34]
continues both processes of previous stage.

[A35]
continues both processes of previous stage.

[A36]
continues both processes of previous stage.

[B1]
both processes achieve endpoint:
oboe jumps subito to doppeltrill and other instruments fall silent.
stage holds state of doppeltrill for quite some time.
materials of following segment already present underneath doppeltrill.
means that truly unaccompanied doppeltrill never appears though psychological
effect of solo doppeltrill obtains.
