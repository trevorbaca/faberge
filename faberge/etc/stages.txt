FABERGÃ‰ INVESTIGATIONS - STAGES

[A]
process of alternation over segment: first term is broken shell, second term is
composite papers and kiln.

first term: broken shell: fast tempo: vn, va, vc harmonic trem. flaut. of frame
descending from bridge. underneath trem. and starting at same time is rapid
exchange of single pitch in other players in preparation for oboe double-trill
of broken shell. exchanged note is fluttertongue in piccolo and color trill in
clarinet; oboe does not yet participate. tremolo flautando frame keeps interest
in dynamic enveloping. string tremolo frame persists subito ppp at end of each
stage as pedal to the following stage. at each pass through alternation note
exchanged between piccolo and clarinet usually rises in stepwise motion and
sometimes falls in stepwise motion that is sometimes inflected microtonally.

second term: papers and kiln: slower effective tempo: single, protracted stroke
of sponge across bass drum head that accelerates exponentially at the end of
most strokes and combines with very sparse lower-register harpsichord notes
second term is a type of intercalation. string tremolo frame crescendos at end
of every second term to resume dynamic presence of first term.

process of alternation: at each successive occurence of second term,
harpsichord density increases and register rises. material starts with very
sparse feather beams that do not yet have the identity of feather beams.
density increases to reveal identity of feather beams. then straight-valued
rhythms interpolate to gradually replace feather beams. endpoint in run-away
harpsichord in only the upper register of the instrument. global accelerandi
and ritardandi inflect endpoint of material.

runaway harpsichord solo with registral compression and metric modualtion.
harpsichord solo represents one facet of the investigation of the kiln and its
parts drawn out in a way that evidences a type of incredible tensile strength.
string tremolo frame is now silent.
brushed bass drum is silent.
oboe has been tacet from beginning of piece.

[B2]
runaway harpsichord continues with registral compression and metric modulation.
oboe enters on succession of three or so trilled notes.

[B3]
runaway harpsichord continues with registral compression and metric modulation.
exchange between piccolo flz and clarinet colortrills returns.
pitch exchange begins process of alternation with oboe trills.
important difference is that oboe line moves pitches between at each attack
but that pitch exchange line insists on single fixed pitch that will
be the terminal pitch-class of oboe doppeltrill.

[B4]
runaway harpsichord continues with registral compression and metric modulation.
oboe returns on succession of more trilled notes played quicker.

[B5]
runaway harpsichord reaches maximum speed and compression.

piccolo fluttertongue, clarinet color trill and sharply bowed crotale.
energy of the way pitch is passed around between players is the energy of the
broken shell.

[B6]

upper instruments vary dynamic enveloping and attack rhythm.
stage holds this state.
pf, percussion tacet.

[D1]
two more processes begin:

pf, percussion still tacet.

[D5]

upper instruments decrease dynamics and rate of attack.
pf, percussion still tacet.

[D6]
oboe irregularly increases dynamics and rate of trill.
upper instruments decrease dynamics and rate of attack.
pf, percussion still tacet.

[D7]
both processes achieve endpoint:
oboe jumps subito to doppeltrill.
upper instruments fall silent and transition into material of next stage.
stage holds state of doppeltrill for quite some time.
materials of following segment already present underneath doppeltrill.
unaccompanied doppeltrill never appears though psychological solo.

[E]
process of alternation over segment: first term is treasure room of mind,
second term is golden gears.

treasure room of mind expressed as tutti polyrhythmic web. picket tuplets in
each part but with pickets frequently broken by a single rest. each attack
expressed as a colortrill in fl, ob, cl; each attack expressed as a
major-second trill in vn, va, vc; each attack expressed as a brushtrill on the
marimba; each attack expressed as a double-struck ribattuto on the harpsichord.
very slow-moving stepwise motion in each part means that pitches are repeated
many times in each part before advancing.

magic of the segment are the music's repeated attempts to transform the
treasure room of mind into golden gears. the transformation freezes a the
polyrhythm of a single line into a sustained pitch that very soon thereafter
begins a glissando lentissimo towards the target pitch of the golden gears. the
'melting' effected by the glissandi lentissimi takes a long time and a
considerable number of repeated attempts. the melting also effects a tempo
change. tempo changes either up or down to tempo of the golden gears, which is
a tutti tempo for the entire ensemble.

[E1]
tutti trm.

[E2]
tutti trm continues.
oboe colortrill freezes into a sustained note and then begins upward glissando

[E13]
