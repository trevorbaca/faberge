MECHANISM
=========

process 1 (80, 64, 51, 41)
--------------------------

    [transformed cells]
    1-1 (80:64@4)
    colored airtone chain alone

    [transformed cells + transformed  cells]
    1-2 (64:51@4)
    colored airtone chain
    low glow cells

    [transformed cells + alternation]
    1-3 (51:41@4)
    colored airtone chain
    low glow cells alternating with suffixed colortrills

    [alternation]
    1-4 (41@4)
    [colored airtone chain drops out]
    low glow cells alternating with suffixed colortrills

    [state]
    1-5 (41@4)
    [low glow cells drop out]
    suffixed colortrills

process 2 (80, 100, 125, 156)
-----------------------------

    [cells + state]
    2-1 (80@4)
    meccanico cells become high glow cells
    [suffixed colortrills persist]

    [transformed cells + fade-out]
    2-2 (80:100@4)
    meccanico cells become high glow cells
    [suffixed colortrills fade out]

    [cells]
    2-3 (100:125@4)
    high glow cells repeat

    [cells]
    2-4 (125:156@4)
    high glow cells repeat

process 3 (156, 125, 100)
-------------------------

    [cellular texture + cells]
    3-1 (156@4)
    ppppp desynchronized rimbalzandi cells
    [high glow cells thin out and fade out]

    [transformation]
    3-2 (156@4)
    ppppp rimbalzandi cells become synchronized

    [cells + fade-in]
    3-3 (156:125@4)
    ppppp synchronized rimbalzandi cells
    ppppp desynchronized suffixed colortrills fade in

    [transformation]
    3-4 (125@4)
    ppp synchronized rimbalzandi cells
    synchronized suffixed colortrills

    [cells]
    3-5 (125@4)
    ppp synchronized rimbalzandi cells
    synchronized suffixed colortrills
    [rimbalzandi cells fade out]

    [transformation]
    3-6 (125:100@4)
    p suffixed colortrills become loure pulses + superball groans

    [cells]
    3-7 (100@4)
    loure pulses with superball groans

    simultaneous woodblock + damped piano articulation of cells
    ppppp, ppp, p

process 4 (51, 64)
------------------

    [texture appears + cells disappear]
    4-1 (51@4)
    continuous clb fades in
    [wind loure pulses with superball groans thin out and fade out]

    [texture persists]
    4-2 (51@4)
    continuous clb

    [texture becomes cells; material appears]
    4-3 (51@4)
    castanets shape clb into cells
    bcl 9-way colorfinger variation fades in

    [cells become material; material persists]
    4-4 (51:64@4)
    castanet clb cells become colored doubletrill castanets
    [bcl 9-way colorfinger variation continues]

    [material persists; material persists]
    4-5 (64@4)
    colored doubletrill castanets
    [bcl 9-way colorfinger variation continues]

process 5 (100, 125, 156)
-------------------------

    [appearance + disappearance + material]
    5-1 (100@4)
    high flute appears incrementally
    [colored doubletrill castanets thin out]
    [bcl 9-way colorfinger variation persists]

    [state + disappearance]
    5-2 (100@4)
    high flute fluttertongue
    [bcl 9-way colorfinger variation fades out]

    [disappearance + appearance]
    5-3 (100:125@4)
    high flute thins out
    tremolo electricity appears incrementally

    [state + appearance]
    5-4 (125:156@4)
    tremolo electricity
    shakers electricity appears incrementally

    [state + state + state]
    5-5 (156@8)
