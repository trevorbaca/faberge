    [high glow cells thin out and fade out]

    [transformation]
    3-2 (156@4)

    [cells + fade-in]
    3-3 (156:125@4)

    ppppp desynchronized suffixed colortrills fade in

    [transformation]
    3-4 (125@4)
    ppp synchronized rimbalzandi cells
    synchronized suffixed colortrills

    [cells]
    3-5 (125@4)
    ppp synchronized rimbalzandi cells

    [rimbalzandi cells fade out]

    [transformation]
    3-6 (125:100@4)
    p suffixed colortrills become loure pulses + superball groans

    [cells]
    3-7 (100@4)
    loure pulses with superball groans

    [texture becomes cells; material appears]
    4-3 (51@4)

    bcl 9-way colorfinger variation fades in

    [cells become material; material persists]
    4-4 (51:64@4)
    castanet clb cells become colored doubletrill castanets
    [bcl 9-way colorfinger variation continues]

    [material persists; material persists]
