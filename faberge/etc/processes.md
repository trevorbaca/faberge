FABERGÃ‰ INVESTIGATIONS - PROCESSES

[A]:

    process of alternation over segment: first term is broken shell, second term is
    composite papers and kiln.

    first term: broken shell: fast tempo: vn, va, vc tremolo flautando descending
    from bridge. underneath tremolo and starting at same time is rapid exchange of
    single pitch in other players in preparation for oboe double-trill of broken
    shell. exchanged note is fluttertongue in piccolo and color trill in clarinet;
    oboe does not yet participate. tremolo flautando keeps interest in
    dynamic enveloping. tremolo flautando persists subito ppp at end of each
    stage as pedal to the following stage. at each pass through alternation note
    exchanged between piccolo and clarinet moves by stepwise motion.

    second term: papers and kiln: slower effective tempo: single, protracted stroke
    of sponge across bass drum head that accelerates exponentially at the end of
    most strokes and combines with very sparse lower-register harpsichord notes
    second term is a type of intercalation. tremolo flautando crescendos at end
    of every second term to resume dynamic presence of first term.

    process: alternation between two terms. at each successive occurence of second
    term, harpsichord density increases and register rises. material starts with
    very sparse feather beams that do not yet have the identity of feather beams.
    density increases to reveal identity of feather beams. then straight-valued
    rhythms interpolate to gradually replace feather beams. endpoint in run-away
    harpsichord in only the upper register of the instrument. global accelerandi
    and ritardandi inflect endpoint of material.

runaway harpsichord solo with registral compression and metric modualtion.
harpsichord solo draws out one facet of the investigation of the kiln.
tremolo flautando is now silent.
brushed bass drum is silent.
oboe has been tacet from beginning of piece.

[B2]
runaway harpsichord continues with registral compression and metric modulation.
oboe enters on succession of three or so trilled notes.

[B3]
runaway harpsichord continues with registral compression and metric modulation.
exchange between piccolo flz and clarinet colortrills returns.
pitch exchange begins process of alternation with oboe trills.
important difference is that oboe line moves pitches between at each attack
but that pitch exchange line insists on single fixed pitch that will
be the terminal pitch-class of oboe doppeltrill.

[B4]
runaway harpsichord continues with registral compression and metric modulation.
oboe returns on succession of more trilled notes played quicker.

[B5]
runaway harpsichord reaches maximum speed and compression.
pitch exchange returns even quicker and now grows to include piccolo
fluttertongue, clarinet color trill and sharply bowed crotale.
energy of pitch passed between players is the energy of the broken shell.

[B6]
runaway harpsichord holds maximum speed and compression.
oboe returns on succession of even more trilled notes played even more quickly.

[B7]

[C10]
percussion falls silent.
both processes achieve endpoint:
oboe now completely continuous.
upper instruments glue into sustained subito mp unison with no reiteration.
upper instruments vary dynamic enveloping and attack rhythm.
stage holds this state.
pf, percussion tacet.

[D1]
two more processes begin:

upper instruments begin decreasing dynamics and rate of attack.
pf, percussion tacet.

[D2]

upper instruments decrease dynamics and rate of attack.
pf, percussion tacet.

[D6]
oboe irregularly increases dynamics and rate of trill.
upper instruments decrease dynamics and rate of attack.
pf, percussion tacet.

[D7]
both processes achieve endpoint:
oboe jumps subito to doppeltrill.
upper instruments fall silent and transition into material of next stage.
stage holds state of doppeltrill for quite some time.
materials of following segment already present underneath doppeltrill.
unaccompanied doppeltrill never appears though psychological solo.

[E1]
stage transforms treasure room of mind into investigation of the golden gears.
treasure room of mind expressed as tutti polyrhythmic web. picket tuplets in
each part but with pickets frequently broken by a single rest. each attack
expressed as a colortrill in fl, ob, cl; each attack expressed as a
major-second trill in vn, va, vc; each attack expressed as a brushtrill on the
marimba; each attack expressed as a double-struck ribattuto on the harpsichord.
very slow-moving stepwise motion in each part means that pitches are repeated
many times in each part before advancing.

magic of the segment are the music's repeated attempts to transform the
treasure room of mind into the golden gears. transformation freezes the
polyrhythm of a single line into a sustained pitch that very soon thereafter
begins a glissando lentissimo towards the target pitch of the golden gears. the
melting effected by the glissandi lentissimi takes a long time and a
considerable number of repeated attempts. the melting also effects a tempo
change.

sustained note. harpsichord resumes chains of double-struck ribattuti as in trm
but with all attacks on the beat. marimba resumes chains of brushtrills but
with all attacks on the beat. marimba also begins process of transition down
compass of the instrument by octaves over the course of several stages. already
