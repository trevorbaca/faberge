\textbf{Instrumentation:}

\begin{itemize} \itemsep2pt
\item Bass flute (doubling flute)
\item English horn
\item Bass clarinet (doubling B$\flat$ clarinet)
\item Piano
\item Percussion
\item Violin
\item Viola
\item Cello
\end{itemize}


\textbf{Accidentals.} Accidentals govern only one note. This is true even for
successive noteheads at the same staff position. \textit{Because of this no
natural signs appear in the score} (with the exception of parenthesized
noteheads in trills). The sequence of, for example, G$\sharp$4 followed by
G4 (without accidental) is to be understood as G$\sharp$4 followed by
G$\natural$4.

\textbf{The winds are tranposed.} The bass flute sounds an octave lower than
written. The English horn sounds a perfect fifth lower than written. The
B$\flat$ clarinet sounds a major second lower than written and the bass
clarinet sounds a major ninth lower than written.

\textbf{Flute.} Bass flute multiphonics refer to Carin Levine's book
\textit{Die Technik der Fl√∂tenspiel}.

\textbf{Piano.} Use a credit card run very slowly laterally up the weaving of
the lowest string of the instrument in the part of the score that requests
individuated clicks.

\textbf{Percussion.} five percussion instruments are required: (1.) marimba;
(2.) bass drum; (3.) crotales in F$\sharp$ and G; (4.) mounted castanets; and
(5.) shakers.

Rolls on the bass drum are all to be as close to attackless as possible: the
rate of the roll doesn't matter but the background depth provided by the
instrument is important.

\textbf{Strings.} Instructions go here.
