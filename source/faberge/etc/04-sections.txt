[A]

    process of alternation over section: first term is broken shell, second
    term is composite papers and kiln.

    first term: broken shell: fast tempo: vn, va, vc tremolo flautando
    descending from bridge. underneath tremolo and starting at same time is
    rapid exchange of single pitch in other players in preparation for oboe
    double-trill of broken shell. exchanged note is fluttertongue in piccolo
    and color trill in clarinet; oboe does not yet participate. tremolo
    flautando keeps interest in dynamic enveloping. tremolo flautando persists
    subito ppp at end of each stage as pedal to the following stage. at each
    pass through alternation note exchanged between piccolo and clarinet moves
    by stepwise motion.

    second term: papers and kiln: slower effective tempo: single, protracted
    stroke of sponge across bass drum head that accelerates exponentially at
    the end of most strokes and combines with very sparse lower-register
    harpsichord notes second term is a type of intercalation. tremolo flautando
    crescendos at end of every second term to resume dynamic presence of first
    term.

    process: alternation between two terms. at each successive occurence of
    second term, harpsichord density increases and register rises. material
    starts with very sparse feather beams that do not yet have the identity of
    feather beams. density increases to reveal identity of feather beams. then
    straight-valued rhythms interpolate to gradually replace feather beams.
    endpoint in run-away harpsichord in only the upper register of the
    instrument. global accelerandi and ritardandi inflect endpoint of material.

[B.1]

    runaway harpsichord solo with registral compression and metric modualtion.
    harpsichord solo draws out one facet of the investigation of the kiln.
    tremolo flautando is now silent.
    brushed bass drum is silent.
    oboe has been tacet from beginning of piece.

[B.2]

    runaway harpsichord continues with registral compression and metric
    modulation. oboe enters on succession of three or so trilled notes.

[B.3]

    runaway harpsichord continues register compression and metric modulation.
    exchange between piccolo flz and clarinet colortrills returns.
    pitch exchange begins process of alternation with oboe trills.
    important difference is that oboe line moves pitches between at each attack
    but that pitch exchange line insists on single fixed pitch that will
    be the terminal pitch-class of oboe doppeltrill.

[B.4]

    runaway harpsichord continues registral compression and metric modulation.
    oboe returns on succession of more trilled notes played quicker.

[B.5]

    runaway harpsichord reaches maximum speed and compression.
    pitch exchange returns even quicker and now grows to include piccolo
    fluttertongue, clarinet color trill and sharply bowed crotale.
    energy of pitch passed between players is the energy of the broken shell.

[B.6]

    runaway harpsichord holds maximum speed and compression.
    oboe returns on succession of even more trilled notes played even quicker.

[B.7]

    runaway harpsichord holds maximum speed and compression.
    pitch exchange returns even quicker and now grows to include piccolo
    fluttertongue, clarinet color trill, sharply bowed crotale and vc
    single-note tremolo played extremely ponticello.

[B.8]

    runaway harpsichord holds maximum speed and compression.
    oboe returns on truly rapid succession of trills still with changing pitch.

[B.9]

    runaway harpsichord holds maximum speed and compression.
    oboe rapid trills continue.
    pitch exchange returns and grows to include piccolo fluttertongue, clarinet
    color trill, sharply bowed crotale, vc xp single-note tremolo, va xp
    single-note tremolo, vn xp single-note tremolo.
    first tutti moment in piece.

[B.10]

[C.2]

    global accelerando continues.

[C.10]

    percussion falls silent.
    both processes achieve endpoint:
    oboe now completely continuous.
    upper instruments glue into sustained subito mp unison with no reiteration.
    upper instruments vary dynamic enveloping and attack rhythm.
    stage holds this state.
    pf, percussion tacet.

[D.1]

    two more processes begin:
    oboe begins irregularly increasing dynamics and rate of trill.
    upper instruments begin decreasing dynamics and rate of attack.
    pf, percussion tacet.

[D.2]

    pf, percussion tacet.

[D.7]

    both processes achieve endpoint:
    oboe jumps subito to doppeltrill.
    upper instruments fall silent and transition into material of next stage.
    stage holds state of doppeltrill for quite some time.
    materials of following section already present underneath doppeltrill.
    unaccompanied doppeltrill never appears though psychological solo.

[E.1]

    stage transforms treasure room of mind into investigation of the golden
    gears. treasure room of mind expressed as tutti polyrhythmic web. picket
    tuplets in each part but with pickets frequently broken by a single rest.
    each attack expressed as a colortrill in fl, ob, cl; each attack expressed
    as a major-second trill in vn, va, vc; each attack expressed as a
    brushtrill on the marimba; each attack expressed as a double-struck
    ribattuto on the harpsichord. very slow-moving stepwise motion in each part
    means that pitches are repeated many times in each part before advancing.

    magic of the section are the music's repeated attempts to transform the
    treasure room of mind into the golden gears. transformation freezes the
    polyrhythm of a single line into a sustained pitch that very soon
    thereafter begins a glissando lentissimo towards the target pitch of the
    golden gears. the melting effected by the glissandi lentissimi takes a long
    time and a considerable number of repeated attempts. the melting also
    effects a tempo change.

    first stage holds tutti trm.
